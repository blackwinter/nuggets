= nuggets - Extending Ruby

== VERSION

This documentation refers to nuggets version 1.6.0.


== DESCRIPTION

Nuggets provides a collection of extensions to Ruby classes.
It's similar to projects like Facets[http://rubyworks.github.com/facets]
and Extensions[http://extensions.rubyforge.org] (or even
Labrador[http://labrador.rubyforge.org]).

This is simply where I put stuff that I need on a more or
less regular basis or that struck me as interesting while
surfing the web, reading books, or following discussions on
ruby-talk[http://lists.ruby-lang.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/ruby-talk].

There are several ways to get the extensions you're interested in:

  # Either require() what you need:
  require 'nuggets/object/singleton_class'
  require 'nuggets/string/sub_with_md'
  require 'nuggets/string/nsub'

  # Or use the helper method (see the documentation of Nuggets()
  # for more examples):
  require 'nuggets'
  Nuggets(object: 'singleton_class', string: %w[sub_with_md nsub])


== NEW NAME

This project used to be named <tt>ruby-nuggets</tt> but was renamed
to +nuggets+ with version 1.0.0. Please update your dependencies.
(Require paths are unchanged.)


== DISCLAIMER

Please be aware that some of the things herein might not work as
