= ruby-nuggets - Some extensions to the Ruby programming language

== VERSION

This documentation refers to ruby-nuggets version 0.6.1


== DESCRIPTION

ruby-nuggets provides a collection of extensions to Ruby core classes. In
its effort, it's similar to projects like Facets[http://facets.rubyforge.org]
and Extensions[http://extensions.rubyforge.org] (or even
Labrador[http://rubyforge.org/projects/labrador/]), though not as ambitious ;-)
This is simply where I put stuff that I need on a more or less regular basis
or that struck me as interesting while surfing the web, reading books, or
following discussions on ruby-talk.

There are several ways to get at the nuggets you're interested in:

  # The usual way: Just require() what you need
  require 'nuggets/object/singleton_class'

  # The more fancy way ;-) (see the documentation of Nuggets() for more examples)
  require 'nuggets'
  Nuggets(:object => 'singleton_class', :string => %w[nsub sub_with_md])

  # Finally, get everything there is...
  require 'nuggets/all'

Please be aware that some of the things herein might not work as expected or
cause other libraries to misbehave. Use at your own risk!
