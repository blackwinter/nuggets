  # Returns an array of every element in _enum_ for which +pattern+ approximately

  # is supplied, each matching element is passed to it, and the blockâ€˜s result
  # is stored in the output array.

  # LIMITATIONS:
  #
  # - Only strings are allowed as +pattern+. Regular expressions are reverted
  #   to their respective source. (Equivalent to <tt>agrep -k</tt>)
  # - Only works with string elements in _enum_. (Calls +to_s+ on each element)
  # - The cost for individual error types (substitution, insertion, deletion)
  #   cannot be adjusted.
